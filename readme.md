# What is COCORE
**COCORE is a Linux distribution for programmable SoC (FPGA+ARM). So, COCORE is an environment for following a system or an application.**

- Hardware and software co-system, co-application.
- Robotic system using FPGA
- Distributed system using FPGA

In COCORE, a file system is based on **Ubuntu 14.04 armhf**, and COCORE includes **Xillybus** and **ROS (Robot Operating System)**.

- [Xillybus](http://xillybus.com/)
- [ROS](http://www.ros.org/)
